# ClientServerTokenManager
Developed a high-performance fail silent replicated distributed system with atomic semantics using gRPC and Go. Implemented atomic semantics using the read-impose-write-all protocol to ensure consistency and reliability. Defined the request and response objects using protobuf, resulting in efficient data transfer and integrity.
